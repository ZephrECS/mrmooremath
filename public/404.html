				<h2>What Davidson Academy Is</h2>
				<p>
					The Davidson Academy is a public school designed specifically for
					profoundly gifted students. It offers an accelerated, highly
					personalized curriculum aimed at students who perform far beyond
					standard grade-level expectations.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Who It Serves</h2>
				<p>
					The school serves students who score in the 99.9th percentile on
					approved intelligence or achievement tests. Admission is competitive
					and based on demonstrated advanced ability rather than age or grade
					level.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>How the Curriculum Works</h2>
				<p>
					The curriculum is flexible and ability-based. Students progress not by
					age, but by demonstrated mastery. Courses cover advanced mathematics,
					sciences, humanities, and interdisciplinary projects designed to
					challenge and stimulate high-level thinkers.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Locations and Options</h2>
				<p>
					There are two main offerings: the on-campus school in Reno, Nevada,
					and the online Davidson Academy Online program. Both provide rigorous
					academic environments but differ in format and daily structure.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Why It’s Not a Typical School</h2>
				<p>
					The Academy emphasizes deep inquiry, self-direction, and intellectual
					community. Students often take university-level courses, engage in
					advanced research, and develop skills needed for high-level academic
					and professional paths.
